Wclcome to the CITA Plasma Group website. We are a group of researchers at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA) at the University of Toronto. Our research focuses on the physics of plasmas in astrophysical environments. We use a combination of analytical theory, numerical simulations, and observational data to study the dynamics of plasmas.
